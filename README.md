# IoT Access Control
## An iot access control solution using ESP 32 and a mobile app
This project is a prototype of an IoT access control system using a mobile application. For this, an ESP32 microcontroller will be used, which will be responsible for releasing access, a WEB server that will perform the authentication and authorization process, and a mobile application, which will be used to detect the access devices, using BLE Low Energy (BLE) to discover these devices, and which will request authorization for the server.
